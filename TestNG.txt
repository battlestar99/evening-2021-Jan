int x; 

double x; 

System.out.println(x);

homapage hp = new homepage(); 

quotepage qp = new quotepage(); 

scanner sc = new scnner(); 
homepage sc = new homepage();

for every page you have to create page object
a page has just one webelement
a page 100 webelements 

Test library or Testing framework: 

TestNG/Junit - test next generation - traditional testing framework 
cucumber - behaviour driven development/testing ( BDD) - 5 years 

why: 

1. it doesnt give us any functionality for passing or failing tests
2. organization of code 
3. it doesn't give us any test report 
4. we can not create a test suite - collection of test cases 
5. data driven testing - cross browser testing 

TestNG installation: 

1. TestNG plugin for eclipse - 
2. TestNG jar file - 


Structure of TestNG 

provides us a template - to run/organize our code 

annotations and sequence in the testing library 

one java class - one test script 

@BeforeTest
public void setupTest(){}
providing pre-requirement of the test 

@Test
public void linktest(){}

@Test
public void logintest(){}


@AfterTest
public void finishTest(){}
provdie post-requirement of the test
