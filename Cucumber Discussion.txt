Cucumber as Testing Library or Testing Framework 

TestNG - 
1. code organization
2. test suite 
3. report 
4. pass/fail scnerio 
5. data driven testing 

Technical type of framework 

manual test case - qa lead, business analyst 
automated test script - automation script 

requirement - testing 

Cucumber - BDD - behaviour driven development 

1. code organization
2. test suite 
3. report 
4. pass/fail scnerio - assertion
5. data driven testing

cucumber has 2 parts - 
non-technical part - manual test case - feature file / featurs 
technical part - automated test script - step definition file/java file

non-technical part -- feature 
feature file - 
scenerio - one test 

gherkin language - gherkin keywords 
given, when, then, and, but 

scenerio : testing the login panel with positive data 
pre-requirement

Given user is on the login page 
When user enters the user id 
And user enters the password 
And user clicks on login button
Then user should be able to login


Given user is on the login page 
When user enters the user id 
And user enters the password 
And user clicks on login button
Then user should be able to login
But user should not be able to login

feature
scenario
background 


given
when
and
then
but 

feaure file >>> non tehnical , we can run it as feature, but in 
reality it can not execute anything 


step definition file >> java file 

connection bewtween feature and step definition: 

1. only sequnce of feature matters, sequence of step def 
doesn't matter
2. steps have to exactly match with the annotations parameter
not any space, not any capital case- lowe case 
3. you can not implement one step multiple time

1. setting up cucumber - libraries and plugin 
2. feature and stepdef 
feature - bdd
given - pre-requirement  
when - action
then - expecing and unexpected 

gherkin keywords - feature, scenerio, given, when, and, then, but 
step def - @Given(dkjksdfjklsdj), @When

background is used if there is common pre-steps 
1. data driven framework in cucumber - datatable
2. page object model - object driven framework

data driven framework in cucumber - 
data table 
scenario outline and example 

selectByVisibleText(arg1)

Test Suite - 
Report - 

we can only feature file - TestRunner  

junit test runner 


Tags - to specify what scenario we want to run 

Hooks - execute before each feature 

@Before - gets executed before the first scenario 
@After - gets executed after the last scenario
