Class - 1 - setup the environment 

what will happen after the class 

1. homeworks - 2 weeks - thursday 
2PM - 3PM - help session - thursday 

2. upload in github code repository 

answering question
writing code 


computer programming 

language 

java - python- c 

1. problem solving - instruction 

 
using any programming language to give instruction to the computer

editor - eclipse 
compiler - traslate our code to machine language - jdk 

2. giving computer instruction - 

walmart.com
adding eggs in the cart
payment and chekcout 


you need to buy a car 

income - budget
look into 5 cars 
compare them based on your preferene - white, sedan, 2 years old, manual
buy the car 

calculate - compute 



data 
logic 



write a software to calculate the mortage payment for your home? 

steps >> 

1. what is the price of the home - 
2. how many years of payment - 
3. apr - percentage rate - 
4. ssn - to check your credit score 
5. down payment 

300000X1.5/100 = a
30X12 - b

ssn>> credit score >> apr>> 1.5

a/b

1. how to store data and how to operate on data 

43232, anik, 33.45, image, boolean 

datatype - int, String, boolean .... float, long, char
200 - memory space - variable 

datatype - variable - dfdf223

declaretion of a variable 
int count;
count=fasf; 
String firstnamename; 
boolean flag; 

x="fdasfd"





declaretion + initialization 

int x; 

x=55;

x=34;

..............................

int x = 34; 

datatype variable = value; 

int income = 100000; 

String carplate= "vs1304";

double apr=1.5;

int x = 15; 

int is the datatype
x is the varible name
15 is the currnet value of the variable 

int String boolean

lets get started with eclipse 

datatype variablename = value; 

int xy = 34; 
String name="dfhd"; 

code syntax - how to store data by creating variables 

java has a basic unit of code - 

class 
 - two types of class 
   run as java application - main method of java 
   can not run - we will discuss later 

eclipse >> 

create a java project - src - write all your code 

Key things: 

1. any name you are going to use, never use a space
camel case - 
iAmGoingToLearn



Java Note: 

1. basic unit of java is a class 

2. 100 classes - 50 class is related mortage problem, 
30 classes are related to solving carprice problem
20 classes are related to scrap data from web 

package mortage
carprice
scrapdata

one class is one script - 

scope - class, methods - starting and ending point defining by 
the {}

java is a case sensitive language 

a and A is not the same thing

value is going from right side to left side 

x=10; 
y=20; 

x=y ;    x=20 y=20

y=x;   x=10,y=10

10 and 11 

10> 11 -- true
10<11 --false 

boolean variable represents results of a condition
