object oriented programming - OOP 

interview purpose - 

class - design/prototype - non-runnble class 

object is the implemenation - 

bankaccount >> 
attributes >> the data system has >> global variable
action >> what the system can >> functions/methods

multiple constructor with different parameter >> constructor overloading
multiple methods with different parameter>> method overloading
static >> only part of class, no relation with object 
access modifier>> 
public >> can be accessed from outside the package, 
inside package, inside class 
private - can only be used inside the class 
proteced - no modifier is same >> can be used inside the same
package but not outside the package
no modifier


relation between multiple classes 
inheritance - child - parent
sub class - super class 
sub class gets all the properties and functions from super class
but super class doesnt get anything from subclass

if parent and child have same function
child class object has to use its own function 
method overriding >> parent and child class
child class object is using its own function and can not use 
the parent class- that calls method overriding 

bankaccount - deposit, withdraw, checkaccount, sendmone
checkingaccount extens bankaccount
savingaccount extends bankaccount
mortageaccount extends bankaccount


abstract class - you can not create an object of the class, 
how to use the functions or properties? 
through the child classes 

interface - create an outline for classes 
in an interface - we can define some functions but can not 
implement them

mozila firefox 
chrome
IE

interface creates an outline of functions that needs to be implemented
when the interface is getting implemented 














code management - maven project, git-github, jenkins
